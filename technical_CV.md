### RESEARCH
Microwave Photonic Synthesizer Characterization for Applications in Radio Astronomy Instrumentation
National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Research Experience for Undergraduates 2022
Tested and characterized laser source for potential use as ngVLA (next-generation Very Large Array)
local oscillator. Presented findings to external engineering representatives and NRAO mentors.
Research Mentor: William Shillue

A Circuit Board Printer for Muon Detector Construction and Classroom Use
Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, Smith College Dept. of Physics 2021
Tested feasibility of a circuit board printer to manufacture components quickly and reliably. Assembled
and tested muon detectors to assess quality of reflow soldering techniques. Designed and built an
adjustable camera mount to improve equipment accessibility. Wrote documentation and user guide to
circuit board printer. Presented results to Smith College Physics and Astronomy departments.
Research Advisor: Dr. Nathanael Fortune

Portable Muon Detectors for Tests of Time Dilation
Student Research In DEpartments (STRIDE), Smith College Dept. of Physics 2020-21
Used custom-built portable muon detectors to collect data at different elevations. Worked with peers to
analyze data collected in various locations. Managed project milestones and scheduled lab meetings
during periods of remote work. Presented results to Smith College Physics and Astronomy departments.
Research Advisor: Dr. Nathanael Fortune

A Python Package for Correction of Magnetic Field Dependence of Resistive Thermometers
Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, Smith College Dept. of Physics 2020
Optimized Python code characterizing resistive thermometers’ response to magnetic fields. Removed
code redundancies by bundling custom functions into a package and defining a class. Automated
essential functions and increased user control over other functions. Managed revisions through Gitlab.
Wrote detailed documentation in Markdown and Python. Code used in analysis for published paper.
Research Advisor: Dr. Nathanael Fortune

Experimental Measurements of Phase Transitions in Superconductors Under Extreme Conditions
Student Research In DEpartments (STRIDE), Smith College Dept. of Physics 2019-20
Designed and fabricated custom lab equipment in a machine shop. Performed soldering under a
microscope. Evaluated and modified test probe electronics and wiring.
Research Advisor: Dr. Nathanael Fortune

### WORKSHOPS
Synthesis Imaging Workshop


Single Dish Summer School (several)


Observer Training Workshop (several)


AstroTech Astronomical Instrumentation Summer School
University of California, Berkeley CA 2022
Designed and built functioning spectrograph with a small team in three days. Assembled
light-integration box for successful calibration of CCD flat-field images. Hands-on sessions covering
optics, teamwork, and instrument development.


National Radio Astronomy Observatory Summer Student Workshop
Green Bank Observatory, Green Bank WV 2022
Designed and carried out an observing project with a 40ft radio telescope in a small-group setting.
Attended lectures on historical and contemporary radio astronomy research and instrumentation. Toured
Green Bank Observatory facilities, including climbing the Green Bank Telescope.


that National High Magnetic Field Lab summer school I did

### COURSEWORK
Observational Techniques in Optical and Infrared Astronomy*
Programmed data reduction pipeline in Python. Observed open star cluster M34 using 16”
Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Produced BVRI images, color-magnitude diagrams, and isochrone fits.


Astronomical Data Science
Demonstrated statistical concepts through collaborative Python programming in Jupyter notebooks and
Google Colab. Independent projects using real-world data with scientific-style papers and presentations.
Focus on best practices in written and visual communication of data.
Project titles:
● Investigation of Links Between Brightness and Orbits in Comets
● Exoplanet Distributions in Systems of Massive Host Stars
● Redesign of Decadal Survey Figure: Impacts of Well-Organized Data Archives


Astronomy & Public Policy
Practiced written and verbal science communication and outreach on topics including light pollution,
contested observatory construction sites, and climate change.


Engineering Seminar: Remote Sensing
Wrote technical memos and frequently presented on published scientific articles. Designed and carried
out a ground-penetrating radar survey project concluding with presentation and formal scientific report.
