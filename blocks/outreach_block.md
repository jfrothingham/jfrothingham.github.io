**Green Bank Observatory Solar Eclipse Party, Volunteer**\
*April 2024 // Green Bank, WV*\
Assisted local community members in safely viewing the sun through a filtered telescope during the April 2024 total solar eclipse. Visitors were able to view 91% of totality from the Green Bank Observatory!


**Green Bank Observatory Star Parties, Volunteer**\
*2024-present // Green Bank, WV and Canaan Valley, WV*\
Operate optical telescopes to assist up to 60 amateur astronomers and students in observing the night sky. Typical monthly star parties include viewing the Moon, various planets, and naked-eye observations of the Milky Way, often in support of scout merit badge awards. Led a star party at the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge as part of the NASA-funded Mission2Mars program.


**Green Bank Observatory SETI Tours, Presenter**\
*Summer 2024 // Green Bank, WV*\
Gave 30-minute presentations on the history and theory of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), with a focus on the Drake Equation and the implications of current search methods in readio astronomy. Presentations given to a general public audience following in-depth tours of telescopes at the Green Bank Observatory historically used in SETI projects.


**Green Bank Obsevatory Family Science Day, Volunteer**\
*2023 // Green Bank, WV*\
