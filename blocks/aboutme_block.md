## ABOUT ME
I am a sometimes-engineer, sometimes-astronomer from Oregon. My pronouns are they/them or he/him.\
\
In my current role providing scientific support at the Green Bank Observatory in rural West Virginia, I work with a world-class team of scientists, engineers, mechanics, and technicians to troubleshoot and repair the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope.\
\
I love taking things apart and learning about systems in-depth. My research work is motivated by a desire to understand the instruments and techniques we use to answer fundamental scientific questions, and to develop those instruments to their full potential. \
\
When not hunched over a laptop or climbing up a telescope, I enjoy spending time with my cats, cooking, being outdoorsy, or playing TTRPGs with friends.
