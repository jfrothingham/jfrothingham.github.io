## WORKSHOPS
**The 20th NRAO Synthesis Imaging Workshop**\
*May 2024 // National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro NM*\
A week of lectures on aperture synthesis theory and techniques at a level appropriate for graduate students in astrophysics, covering both radio interferometry fundamentals and state-of-the-art methods and techniques. Discussion groups and tutorials demonstrating data collection, calibration, and imaging of various types of observations, including new data from the Very Large Array (VLA), Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA),  and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). 


**Single Dish Summer School** - Presenter, Observing Group Leader\
*2023, 2024 // Green Bank Observatory, Green Bank WV*\
Gave 30-45 minute presentations on single-dish radio astronomy and very long baseline interferometry. Assisted small groups with observation preparation, observing, and data reduction with a 20m-diameter radio telescope.


**Green Bank Telescope Observer Training Workshop** - Presenter, Observing Group Leader\
*2023 - Present // Green Bank Observatory, Green Bank WV*\
Demonstrated observing procedures with the Green Bank Telescope. Assisted small groups with observation preparation, observing, and data reduction. Observations included spectral line, mapping, and pulsar observations at high (>20GHz) and low (<1.4GHz) frequencies using a 100m-diameter radio telescope. 


**AstroTech Astronomical Instrumentation Summer School**\
*August 2022 // University of California, Berkeley CA*\
Designed and built functioning spectrograph with a small team in three days. Assembled light-integration box for successful calibration of CCD flat-field images. Hands-on sessions covering optics, teamwork, and instrument development.


**National Radio Astronomy Observatory Summer Student Workshop**\
*June 2022 // Green Bank Observatory, Green Bank WV*\
Designed and carried out an observing project with a 40ft radio telescope in a small-group setting. Attended lectures on historical and contemporary radio astronomy research and instrumentation. Toured Green Bank Observatory facilities, including climbing the Green Bank Telescope.
