## COURSEWORK

**Course highlights**\
Physics through quantum mechanics\
Mathematics through multivariate calculus\
Astronomy including telescopes and astrophysics\
Engineering mechanics, circuit theory, thermodynamics


**Observational Techniques in Optical and Infrared Astronomy**\
Programmed data reduction pipeline in Python. Observed open star cluster M34 using 16‚Äù Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Produced BVRI images, color-magnitude diagrams, and isochrone fits.\

**Astronomical Data Science**\
Demonstrated statistical concepts through collaborative Python programming in Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab. Independent projects using real-world data with scientific-style papers and presentations. Focus on best practices in written and visual communication of data.\
Project titles:
- Investigation of Links Between Brightness and Orbits in Comets
- Exoplanet Distributions in Systems of Massive Host Stars
- Redesign of Decadal Survey Figure: Impacts of Well-Organized Data Archives\

**Astronomy & Public Policy**\
Practiced written and verbal science communication and outreach on topics including light pollution, contested observatory construction sites, and climate change.


**Engineering Seminar: Remote Sensing**\
Wrote technical memos and frequently presented on published scientific articles. Designed and carried out a ground-penetrating radar survey project concluding with presentation and formal scientific report.\
