## COURSEWORK

**Course highlights**\
Physics through quantum mechanics\
Mathematics through multivariate calculus\
Astronomy including telescopes and astrophysics\
Engineering mechanics, circuit theory, thermodynamics


**Observational Techniques in Optical and Infrared Astronomy**\
Programmed data reduction pipeline in Python. Observed open star cluster M34 using 16‚Äù Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Produced BVRI images, color-magnitude diagrams, and isochrone fits.


**Astronomical Data Science**\
Demonstrated statistical concepts through collaborative Python programming in Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab. Independent projects using real-world data with scientific-style papers and presentations. Focus on best practices in written and visual communication of data.\
Project titles:
- Investigation of Links Between Brightness and Orbits in Comets
- Exoplanet Distributions in Systems of Massive Host Stars
- Redesign of Decadal Survey Figure: Impacts of Well-Organized Data Archives


**Astronomy & Public Policy**\
Practiced written and verbal science communication and outreach on topics including light pollution, contested observatory construction sites, and climate change.


**Engineering Seminar: Remote Sensing**\
Wrote technical memos and frequently presented on published scientific articles. Designed and carried out a ground-penetrating radar survey project concluding with presentation and formal scientific report.


**Foucault Pendulum Repair (Physics)**\
Self-designed project to repair and possibly redesign non-functioning drive mechanism for Foucault pendulum displayed on Smith College campus. Developed display materials to increase awareness and educational impact of the Foucault pendulum.


**Engineering: Signals and Systems**\
Upper-level elective covering signal processing techniques. Labs and data analysis performed in Matlab. Projects included removal of an echo from audio signals, design and use of an AM radio receiver, and analysis of heartbeats collected from an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine.


**Electronics Lab**\
Hands-on physics course covering AC circuits, DC circuits, semiconductors, and amplifiers through projects and lectures. Project videos available [here.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO8OYopm6CLzEvS_EEiAig1PXHBe6Y2V-&si=fjuxHdKG-yCm6hrz)
