### COURSEWORK

**Course highlights**\
Engineering mechanics, circuit theory, thermodynamics \ 
Physics through quantum mechanics \ 
Mathematics through multivariate calculus \
Introductory chemistry \
Astronomy including telescopes and astrophysics \


**Observational Techniques in Optical and Infrared Astronomy**\
Programmed data reduction pipeline in Python. Observed open star cluster M34 using 16” Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Produced BVRI images, color-magnitude diagrams, and isochrone fits.


**Astronomical Data Science**\
Demonstrated statistical concepts through collaborative Python programming in Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab. Independent projects using real-world data with scientific-style papers and presentations. Focus on best practices in written and visual communication of data.\
Project titles:\
● Investigation of Links Between Brightness and Orbits in Comets\
● Exoplanet Distributions in Systems of Massive Host Stars\
● Redesign of Decadal Survey Figure: Impacts of Well-Organized Data Archives\


**Astronomy & Public Policy**\
Practiced written and verbal science communication and outreach on topics including light pollution, contested observatory construction sites, and climate change.


**Engineering Seminar: Remote Sensing**\
Wrote technical memos and frequently presented on published scientific articles. Designed and carried out a ground-penetrating radar survey project concluding with presentation and formal scientific report.


**Foucault Pendulum Repair (Physics)**\
Self-designed project to repair and possibly redesign non-functioning drive mechanism for Foucault pendulum displayed on Smith College campus. Will additionally develop display materials and sample lesson plans to increase awareness and educational impact of the Foucault pendulum.
